# Failure modes

How each kardamom actor fails, what it costs, how it recovers, and where that
behavior is verified. Grounded in the failover specs (`docs/agents/`), the
chaos suite (`deploy/cluster/scripts/chaos.sh` — case names appear like
`cluster-leader-kill` throughout; most run in CI via
`.github/workflows/cluster-e2e.yml`), and the recovery code itself.

The design in one line: everything on the hot path is either **replicated
shared-nothing** (ingress, executor), **sharded with retry semantics**
(sequencer), or **Raft-replicated with fail-stall-on-quorum-loss** (sealer);
everything off the hot path is allowed to die and catch up (batcher,
da-watcher) or die loudly (validator).

## Sealer — the Aeron Cluster (Raft)

The ordering authority, and historically the hard SPOF: the old standalone
sealer's crash froze every executor permanently (`sealer-hard`, kept only to
reproduce the legacy gap; issue #58). The 3-member Aeron Cluster replaces that
with three distinct, tested modes:

![Sealer cluster failure states](img/states-sealer-cluster.jpg)

- **Leader hard-kill** (`cluster-leader-kill`) — quorum survives, a leader is
  re-elected (possibly the restarted member re-winning, since it has the most
  up-to-date log — the suite asserts *the pipeline keeps committing*, not
  *the leader changed*), clients redirect via `NewLeaderEvent`. Replicated
  state + snapshots hand the new leader `{dedup window, canonical count,
  block_number}`: no gap, no block-number regress.
- **Follower kill** (`cluster-follower-kill`) — quorum 2/3 holds; **zero
  stall** is asserted and the leader must be unchanged. The member restarts
  and rejoins.
- **Quorum loss** (`cluster-quorum-loss-recover`) — two nodes killed: the
  pipeline **must stall** (the suite asserts the executor block gauge goes
  *flat* — progress without quorum would be unsafe, unreplicated ordering).
  One node returning restores quorum, but this is the one case where client
  cluster *sessions* die (the outage exceeds the session timeout): re-election
  + session re-establishment + log replay takes ~50 s+ observed (SLO 180 s),
  then the backlog drains gaplessly.

## Executor

![Executor failure states](img/states-executor.jpg)

- **Process crash** (`graceful-executor` / `hard-executor`) — Nomad restarts
  it; startup reads the libMDBX `meta` cursors (`last_committed_block`,
  `last_committed_end_tx_position`) and replays the canonical stream from the
  Aeron archives via a replay-merge, skip-counting past the durable cursor.
  State is committed durably per block, so there is no double-apply and no
  genesis re-sync; the `DedupWindow` absorbs any reconnect overlap.
- **Whole-node loss** (`node-failure-executor`) — with `distinct_hosts` there
  is no spare node to reschedule onto: the fleet degrades 3/3 → 2/3 and must
  keep progressing; the returned node rejoins to 3/3. Replicas are
  deterministic state machines, so one dead or lagging replica never blocks
  the others.
- **Wedged (frozen)** — an executor whose block gauge is flat *while sealer
  boundaries keep advancing* is the load harness's FROZEN verdict; that
  contrast (rather than absolute progress) is what distinguishes a wedged
  replica from a quiescent chain.
- **Leader failover above it** is invisible: the cluster client hides
  reconnects from the reader thread.

## Ingress (×N, active/active)

- **Replica, node, or its media-driver death** (`hard-ingress`,
  `archive-driver-loss`) — costs only that replica's in-flight clients, who
  retry against a survivor. Replicas are shared-nothing (no leader, no sticky
  sessions); any replica can accept any sender's tx.
- **The failure this design had to solve:** a tx accepted by replica A whose
  client retries against replica B. Receipts are multicast to **all**
  replicas (invariant I-B in `docs/agents/resilient-ingress-spec.md`), so B
  answers from its `SeenReceipts` cache without republishing. The dangerous
  mode is a **frozen multicast group** — one stuck subscriber stalling receipt
  fan-out; the `ci-cluster.sh` ingress-churn step reproduces exactly that.
- **Ack-policy window:** the default `on-offer` acks once the tx is offered
  to the pipeline, so a replica dying after the ack but before its
  publication is durable can lose that tx. The `on-quorum` gate (ack only
  after the Raft cluster commits) exists for when that window matters.

## Sequencer (×2, sharded by sender)

- **Crash** (`graceful-` / `hard-sequencer`) — its sender-shard stalls until
  the restart (nonce state rebuilds from the stream); the other shard is
  unaffected.
- **Backpressure, not loss** — a refused cluster offer maps to
  `SequencerError::Backpressure` and the rewind/retry path; the failure mode
  is latency, never a dropped record.
- **Racing duplicates are expected** — replicas publishing concurrently are
  deduped by the cluster's first-seen window on the 32-byte `canonical_id`.

![Edge and off-hot-path failure states](img/states-edge-offpath.jpg)

## Validator (off hot path, fail-stop by design)

The failure philosophy is inverted: **halting is the feature**. On any
divergence — re-executed receipts or BAL disagreeing with the executor's, or
an MPT state-root mismatch — it stops rather than continuing on bad state,
and stays stopped until an operator intervenes. A crashed validator costs
verification coverage, never L2 liveness; nothing on the hot path consumes it.

## Batcher (offline, archive-driven)

A crash costs **DA freshness only** — L2 keeps sequencing and executing.
Because it reads the canonical stream from the durable Aeron archives rather
than live channels, it can restart late and catch up; the failure mode is a
growing L1-posting lag, not data loss. Its real dependencies are archive
availability and L1 gas/RPC health.

## DA-watcher

Tick-based with an in-memory cursor: any RPC or publish error leaves the
cursor unadvanced and the next tick retries the same `(cursor, tip]` range —
at-least-once within a run. Duplicates after a retry or restart are absorbed
downstream by the first-seen dedup on `source_hash`. A dead watcher stalls
deposits only, and it reads *finalized* L1 blocks, so reorgs are out of scope
by construction.

## Substrate (the shared failure domain)

- **ArchivingMediaDriver** — one combined Media Driver + Archive JVM per node
  (the `aeron` Nomad system job). A driver death takes down every service on
  that node in one blow: transport *and* that node's durability recorder.
  `archive-driver-loss` kills it under ingress-0 and asserts the pipeline
  rides through (active/active), the system task restarts within the SLO
  (archive segments persist on the node volume), and the ingress job returns
  to full strength.
- **Archives** — durable `tx_ordering` (folded into the Raft log + per-member
  archive) and per-sequencer `tx_data`; they underpin executor resume and the
  batcher.

## Known gaps (untested failure surface)

- **Archive *data* loss** — `archive-driver-loss` covers the process; nothing
  yet wipes a node's archive volume and exercises executor resume or batcher
  reads against missing segments.
- **L1 outage** — the batcher's behavior under sustained L1 RPC failure /
  gas spikes is designed (lag + catch-up) but not chaos-tested.
- **Validator divergence injection** — fail-stop is unit-tested, but no e2e
  case feeds the validator a corrupted receipt/BAL stream.
